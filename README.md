In this project we had to create three animated buttons using css while also having transitions and interactivity on the buttons.
With my first button I created a button that hovers with a lighter shade of the main colour as you hover over it.
My second button is a white button with black borders around that turns green as you hover it.
My last button is a purple with some white gradient, that turns white as you hover over it whiile also having a purple border on the bottom and right of the button.
I struggled with designing the animamtions, I feel like they didn't come out as I had originally pictured them and I feel like I could've done much better. I do feel like I did my best though and that the buttoms do look presentable.
